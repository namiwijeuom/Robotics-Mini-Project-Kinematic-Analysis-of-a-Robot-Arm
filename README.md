# Robotics Mini Project Kinematic Analysis of a Robot Arm
 The objective of this mini project is to perform a kinematic analysis of a simple robot arm (3 DoF or more) constructed using servo motors. You can either build your custom robot arm or purchase a commercial hobby type robot arm. The analysis will involve creating a Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) table, calculating the forward kinematics, and deriving the inverse kinematics for a pick and place task.
